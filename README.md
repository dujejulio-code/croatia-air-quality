# Croatia Air Quality Analysis (2019-2025)

> ⚠️ Raw data files (~700MB) are not included due to GitHub size limits. All SQL scripts, DAX measures, dashboard exports, and documentation are fully available.

**End-to-end data analytics project:** raw CSV files → PostgreSQL galaxy schema → Power BI interactive dashboard

Analyzing 7 years of hourly air pollution and weather data across 6 Croatian cities to uncover when, where, and why air quality deteriorates.

## Project Overview


This project transforms that raw data into an analytical platform that answers real questions:
- **Which cities have the worst air?** Zagreb and Osijek dominate — driven by winter heating and continental geography
- **When is it worst?** Winter months, weekday rush hours, and temperature inversions create pollution traps
- **What drives it?** Temperature has the strongest correlation with PM2.5 (r = -0.28) - cold air literally traps pollution at ground level
- **Did COVID change anything?** YES - NO₂ dropped during lockdown and never fully recovered, suggesting lasting behavioral shifts
- **How long do pollution episodes last?** Zagreb winter episodes average 40+ hours above WHO thresholds, with some exceeding 300 hours

## Data Model

The database uses a **galaxy schema** (two fact tables sharing dimension tables):

![Data Model](screenshots/data_model.png)

**Fact Tables:**
- `air_quality_fact` - ~8 million rows of hourly pollutant measurements (7 pollutants × 19 stations × 6 years)
- `city_weather_fact` - ~400K rows of hourly weather observations (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, cloud cover, radiation)

**Dimension Tables:**
- `dim_date` - calendar with season, day-of-week, week/month numbering, COVID period flag
- `dim_time` - 24 hours with time-of-day labels and rush hour flag
- `dim_location` - 6 cities with coordinates
- `dim_station` - 19 monitoring stations linked to cities
- `dim_pollutant` - 7 pollutants with EAQI thresholds, units, source descriptions
- `dim_aqi_category` - 5-level European AQI classification with color coding

**Analytical Tables (built in SQL):**
- `weather_statistics` - CORR() and REGR_SLOPE() for every pollutant × weather variable combination, with PERCENT_RANK() trimming to 1st–99th percentile
- `pm25_episodes` - gaps-and-islands window function analysis identifying continuous PM2.5 exceedance episodes, peak values, duration, and recovery time
- `wind_pollution` - cross-fact-table view joining air quality with wind direction data
- `aqi_exceedance_profile` - percentage of hours in each AQI category by city and season

## Key SQL Highlights

### CROSS JOIN LATERAL - Unpivoting Wide to Long

The raw CSV files have one column per pollutant (wide format). The fact table needs one row per measurement (long format). `CROSS JOIN LATERAL` is the PostgreSQL way to do this efficiently:

```sql
CREATE TABLE air_quality_db.air_quality_all_unpivot AS
SELECT id, date, time, location, station, pollutant, measured_value
FROM air_quality_db.air_quality_all
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    VALUES
        ('benzen', benzen), ('co', co), ('no2', no2), ('o3', o3),
        ('pm10', pm10), ('pm25', pm25), ('so2', so2)
) AS unpivot (pollutant, measured_value);
```

### Gaps-and-Islands - PM2.5 Episode Detection

Identifying continuous pollution episodes requires detecting when consecutive hours stay above a threshold. The `LAG()` + cumulative `SUM()` pattern groups these into episodes:

```sql
-- Flag episode starts: gap > 1 hour between consecutive above-threshold readings
CASE 
    WHEN ts - LAG(ts) OVER (PARTITION BY city, threshold_ug ORDER BY ts) > INTERVAL '1 hour'
    OR LAG(ts) IS NULL
    THEN 1 ELSE 0 
END AS is_episode_start

-- Running sum of starts = episode ID
SUM(is_episode_start) OVER (PARTITION BY city, threshold_ug ORDER BY ts) AS episode_id
```

### Weather Correlation with Outlier Trimming

Raw correlations can be distorted by sensor errors. The analysis uses `PERCENT_RANK()` to trim the 1st and 99th percentiles before computing `CORR()` and `REGR_SLOPE()`:

```sql
WITH daily_avg AS (
    SELECT fk_date_id, fk_location_id, pollutant_short,
           AVG(measured_value) AS avg_pollution,
           AVG(temperature_2m_c) AS avg_temp, ...
    FROM air_quality_fact a
    JOIN city_weather_fact w ON a.fk_date_id = w.fk_date_id
        AND a.fk_location_id = w.fk_location_id AND a.fk_time_id = w.fk_time_id
    GROUP BY fk_date_id, fk_location_id, pollutant_short
),
cleaned AS (
    SELECT * FROM (
        SELECT *, PERCENT_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY pollutant_short ORDER BY avg_pollution) AS pct_rank
        FROM daily_avg
    ) t WHERE pct_rank BETWEEN 0.01 AND 0.99
)
SELECT pollutant_short, 'temperature',
       CORR(avg_temp, avg_pollution)::DECIMAL(5,3),
       REGR_SLOPE(avg_pollution, avg_temp)::DECIMAL(10,4)
FROM cleaned GROUP BY pollutant_short;
```

## Key DAX Measures

```dax
// AQI Ratio - average measured value relative to the "Good" threshold
// Values > 1.0 mean the city exceeded the Good limit on average
Aqi Ratio = 
AVERAGEX(
    air_quality_fact,
    DIVIDE(
        air_quality_fact[measured_value],
        RELATED(dim_pollutant[good_threshold])
    )
)

// Day-of-week deviation - how much each day deviates from the weekly mean
// Positive = dirtier than average, negative = cleaner
Avg Measured Value / Day of Week = 
VAR DayAvg = AVERAGE(air_quality_fact[measured_value])
VAR WeekAvg = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(air_quality_fact[measured_value]),
    REMOVEFILTERS(dim_date[day_of_week])
)
RETURN DIVIDE(DayAvg - WeekAvg, WeekAvg) * 100

// Cross-fact-table measure using CROSSFILTER
// Enables joining air_quality_fact with city_weather_fact through shared dimensions
Avg PM25 for Weather = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(air_quality_fact[measured_value]),
    CROSSFILTER(city_weather_fact[fk_date_id], dim_date[pk_date_id], Both),
    air_quality_fact[pollutant] = "pm25"
)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Zagreb and Osijek** consistently have the worst air quality, driven by continental climate (cold winters, low wind) and residential heating
2. **Winter is 2-4× worse than summer** across all inland cities - PM2.5 is the dominant winter pollutant, while O3 dominates summer
3. **Weekdays are dirtier than weekends** (CO and NO₂ deviate up to +8% on Fridays vs -18.6% on Sundays), confirming traffic as a major source
4. **COVID lockdown permanently reduced NO₂** - levels dropped in March 2020 and post-COVID (2021–2024) averages never returned to 2019 levels
5. **Temperature inversions trap pollution** - the negative correlation between temperature and PM2.5 (r = -0.28) reflects cold, stagnant air preventing pollutant dispersion
6. **Wind is the best natural cleaner** - higher wind speed consistently correlates with lower pollution across all pollutants
7. **Coastal cities (Dubrovnik, Split, Vis)** enjoy naturally cleaner air due to sea breezes and milder winters
